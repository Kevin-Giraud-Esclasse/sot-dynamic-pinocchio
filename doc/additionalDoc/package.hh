\section sec_intro Introduction

The sot-dynamic package is a bridge between the stack of tasks framework and the dynamicsJRLJapan library.
It provides an inverse dynamic model of the robot through dynamic-graph entities.

This class provides an inverse dynamic model of the robot. More precisely it wraps the newton euler algorithm implemented by the dynamicsJRLJapan library to make it accessible in the stack of tasks
controllers in the Stack of Tasks Framework as defined in \ref Mansard2007.
